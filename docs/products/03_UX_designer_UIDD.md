# User Interface Description Document

This document describes the user interface design for the mobile application, based on the "Clean & Focused" design option.

## Layout Structure

The application will primarily utilize a simple, top-down layout structure. The home screen will feature a prominent search bar at the top, with search results displayed in a vertically scrollable list below it. The video detail screen will present the video title and transcript in a clean, linear flow, optimized for readability.

## Core Components

*   **Search Bar:** A text input field with a clear button, used for entering keywords.
*   **Search Results List:** A scrollable list view where each item represents a viral video result. Each list item will display the video title and a small thumbnail.
*   **Loading Indicator:** A visual element (e.g., a spinner) displayed while the app is fetching data from the n8n webhook.
*   **Video Title Display:** A text element to show the title of the selected viral video on the detail screen.
*   **Transcript Display:** A scrollable text area to display the full transcript of the video on the detail screen.
*   **Error Message Display:** Text elements or dialogs to show user-friendly error messages.

## Interaction patterns

*   **Keyword Entry:** Users type keywords into the search bar. Tapping a search button or the enter key will trigger the search.
*   **Clear Search:** Tapping a clear button within the search bar will clear the entered keywords.
*   **View Video Details:** Tapping on a video item in the search results list will navigate the user to the video detail screen.
*   **Scrolling:** Standard vertical scrolling for the search results list and the transcript display.
*   **Back Navigation:** Users will use standard mobile navigation patterns (e.g., back button on the device or a back arrow in the app bar) to return from the video detail screen to the search results.

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme

The visual design will be clean and professional, emphasizing usability and readability. A minimalist color palette will be used, likely with a primary accent color and a neutral background. Ample whitespace will be incorporated to reduce visual clutter. The focus will be on presenting the information clearly and efficiently.

## Mobile, Web App, Desktop considerations

The primary design is optimized for mobile devices. The layout will be responsive to scale gracefully on larger mobile screens and tablets. For potential future web or desktop versions, the core "Clean & Focused" layout principles would be maintained, adapting the search bar placement and results display to utilize the increased screen real estate while preserving the simple, readable presentation of video details and transcripts.

## Typography

A single, highly readable sans-serif font will be used throughout the application for all text elements. This ensures consistency and prioritizes the clear presentation of information, especially the video transcripts. Font sizes will be chosen to ensure readability on various screen sizes.

## Accessibility

Accessibility will be a consideration in the design. This includes:

*   Using a high contrast color scheme to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.
*   Providing options for adjusting font sizes.
*   Ensuring interactive elements are clearly labeled and have sufficient touch target sizes.
*   Designing for compatibility with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
