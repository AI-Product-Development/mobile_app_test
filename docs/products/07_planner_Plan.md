# Project Implementation Plan (Frontend MVP with Dummy Backend)

This plan outlines the phased implementation for the initial prototype (MVP) of the mobile application, focusing on a functional Flutter frontend that interacts with a dummy backend for data, based on the provided design documents. The backend API and n8n integration are excluded from this MVP scope.

## Phase 2: Flutter Frontend Setup and Search UI

This phase focuses on setting up the Flutter project and implementing the user interface for keyword input and displaying search results based on the UIDD.

- [ ] Initialize Flutter project (Easy)
- [ ] Add necessary dependencies (e.g., http or dio for API calls, provider/riverpod/bloc for state management) (Easy)
- [ ] Implement the Home Screen UI with a search bar and a results display area (Medium)
- [ ] Implement state management for handling keyword input, loading state, and search results (Medium)
- [ ] Implement logic to call the backend `POST /api/v1/search` endpoint with entered keywords (Medium)
- [ ] Display a loading indicator while fetching search results (Easy)
- [ ] Display the received viral video results in a list format based on the UIDD (Medium)
- [ ] Implement basic error handling in the frontend to display messages to the user (Medium)

## Phase 3: Video Detail Screen and Transcript Display

This phase focuses on implementing the screen to display the full video transcript.

- [ ] Implement the Video Detail Screen UI to display video title and transcript (Medium)
- [ ] Implement navigation from the search results list to the video detail screen, passing necessary data (Medium)
- [ ] Display the full transcript on the Video Detail Screen (Easy)
- [ ] Implement back navigation from the video detail screen (Easy)

## Phase 4: Testing with Hardcoded Dummy Data

This phase focuses on testing the Flutter frontend functionality using the hardcoded dummy data.

- [ ] Run Flutter application on emulator or device.
- [ ] Perform end-to-end test: Enter keywords, verify results display using hardcoded data.
- [ ] Test various keywords and edge cases with hardcoded dummy data.
- [ ] Test frontend error handling scenarios with hardcoded data (e.g., displaying a message if no results match a keyword).
- [ ] Refine UI/UX based on testing feedback (layout, loading indicators, error messages, navigation flow).
